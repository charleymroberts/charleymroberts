## Hello and welcome to my page!

I am a Sheffield-based (UK) junior software developer and career-changer seeking my first professional tech role. Right now I'm also open to short-term/temporary work or work placements to help me build up professional tech experience.

As well as my tech skills acquired so far and motivation to learn more, I can also offer knowledge of public libraries, the charity sector, independent retail/small business and live music events from my current and previous work. (Plus I make a great vegan cake if staffroom treats are your thing...)

### Tech experience so far

I recently completed the Code Institute one-year full stack software development programme (finished at the end of September 2023). 

The main technologies I covered are:

- Python/Django/SQL backend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap frontend
- Ecommerce including using Stripe and AWS
- UX/UI design principles
- Agile methodogies
- GitHub 
- Participation in hackathons for groupwork

Plus obviously I am very keen to learn more technologies as part of my future job role!

**For my 5 assessed coursework projects, I produced:**

- An online shop with Python/Django using Stripe for payment processing and AWS for image storage [GitHub](https://github.com/charleymroberts/ecommerce) [Deployed version](https://vegandirect-2d439acd3be5.herokuapp.com/)
- 'Festival Events Manager' fullstack Python/Django app [GitHub](https://github.com/charleymroberts/events-manager) [Deployed version](https://festival-manager-2ef1a8933d4d.herokuapp.com/)
- 'Workout Tracker' Python app [GitHub](https://github.com/charleymroberts/workout-tracker) [Deployed version](https://cr-workout-tracker.herokuapp.com/)
- 'Flashcards' language learning game using JavaScript [GitHub](https://github.com/charleymroberts/flashcards) [Deployed version](https://charleymroberts.github.io/flashcards/)
- an HTML/CSS website for contra dance band Vertical Expression [GitHub](https://github.com/charleymroberts/vx-website) [Deployed version](https://www.verticalexpressioncontra.co.uk)

**Personal projects:**

I recently developed a simple, mobile-friendly website for a local church, using HTML, CSS and Boostrap 5. [Bamford Methodist Church website](https://www.bamfordmethodists.org.uk)

Now that I have finished my course, I have plans to develop some personal projects to keep improving my skills.  I also aim to extend my Festival Events Manager project into software that can be used in the real world by festivals.

### Work history

I have previous professional experience in public libraries, the charity sector and as an independent retail business owner (including the use of various ecommerce software as a business user).

I currently work as a live sound engineer, occasional gigging musician and [(volunteer) music festival organiser](https://www.whitbyfolk.co.uk/).
