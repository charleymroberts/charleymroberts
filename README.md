### Hello and welcome to my page!

I am a Sheffield-based (UK) junior software developer (Python/Django) and career-changer seeking my first professional tech role. Right now I'm also open to short-term/temporary work or work placements to help me build up professional tech experience.

As well as my tech skills acquired so far and motivation to learn more, I can also offer knowledge of public libraries, the charity sector, independent retail/small business and live music events from my current and previous work. (Plus I make a great vegan cake if staffroom treats are your thing...)

**Tech experience so far**

I recently completed the Code Institute one-year full stack software development programme (finished at the end of September 2023). 

The main technologies I covered are:

Python/Django/SQL backend
HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap frontend
Ecommerce including using Stripe and AWS
UX/UI design principles
Agile methodogies
GitHub 
Participation in hackathons for groupwork

Plus obviously I am very keen to learn more technologies as part of my future job role!

For my 5 assessed coursework projects, I produced:

- An online shop with Python/Django using Stripe for payment processing and AWS for image storage
- 'Festival Events Manager' fullstack Python/Django app 
- 'Workout Tracker' Python app
- 'Flashcards' language learning game using JavaScript
- an HTML/CSS website for contra dance band Vertical Expression

**Work history**

I have previous professional experience in public libraries, the charity sector and as an independent retail business owner (including the use of various ecommerce software as a business user).

I currently work as a live sound engineer, occasional gigging musician and (volunteer) music festival organiser.
